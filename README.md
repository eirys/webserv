# webserv
My 42 project webserv, group project with efrancon & emtran

`make`
Toggles `CUTIE`. This activates features (within our webserv) to allow our website to function well, since we kinda went overboard with the actual website...

No leaks, or wild fds.
100% availability on siege, using epoll.

NB: This code was adapted to work well -if I may say so myself- on Chrome.
